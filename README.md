# Build and runtime dependencies

Clone repo and install build dependencies:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/aweeraman/odyssey.git
$ sudo apt-get install git gcc g++ make m4 bison flex bzip2 xz-utils curl zlib1g-dev gnat python
```

Build GCC cross compilers for i386, armv7-a and boot loaders:

```
$ cd odyssey
$ make deps
```

Install additional dependencies required for building and running odyssey
in qemu:

```
$ sudo apt-get install grub-common mtools qemu-system-gui qemu-system-x86 qemu-system-arm ovmf exuberant-ctags u-boot-tools netpbm
```

Optionally, if you wish to use clang, you can install it and configure
it in the build config as follows:

```
$ sudo apt-get install clang
```

Set the following variables in config/build.cfg to use clang:

```
CC        := clang
```

nasm is built as part of the cross compiler dependencies and can be
used in place GNU as for building the assembly programs by setting
the following in in config/build.cfg. The GNU assembler will be used
by default.

```
AS        := deps/coreboot/util/crossgcc/xgcc/bin/nasm
```

# Running in qemu

To build and run in qemu:

```
$ make boot
```

or, to build the ARM version:

```
$ make ARCH=arm boot
```

To build and run in qemu with Coreboot:

```
$ make boot-coreboot
```

To build and run in qemu with OVMS/EFI:

```
$ make boot-efi
```

# Running in qemu on ARM/U-Boot

Install a tftp-server to serve the OS image:

```
$ sudo apt-get install tftpd-hpa lrzsz
$ sudo systemctl start tftpd-hpa
```

Build the OS image and copy over to the tftp server location:

```
$ make ARCH=arm image
$ sudo cp odyssey.img /srv/tftp
$ make ARCH=arm boot-uboot
```

At the U-Boot prompt, enter the following:

```
setenv ipaddr 10.x.x.x
setenv serverip 192.x.x.x
tftp 80000000 odyssey.img
iminfo 80000000
bootm 80000000
```

# Configuration

List capabilities to be included in the kernel in config/kernel.cfg.
Currently available options are:

```
# Prefix with a leading hash (#) to disable a feature

CONFIG_VERSION_MAJOR=0
CONFIG_VERSION_MINOR=1

# Drivers / hardware support
CONFIG_SERIAL
CONFIG_KEYBOARD

# Framebuffer console
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_RGB
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_WIDTH=1024
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_HEIGHT=768
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_BPP=32

# FirstFit memory manager
CONFIG_MM_FF

# Run tests during boot
CONFIG_TEST
```

# Running on hardware

## Intel

Odyssey has been tested on a Minnowboard Turbot B, a quad-core Atom-based
x86 single board computer.

![Minnowboard Turbot B](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aweeraman/odyssey/master/docs/img/minnowboard_turbot_b.jpg
"Minnowboard Turbot B")

To configure GRUB, set a custom boot configuration such as follows:

```
menuentry "odyssey" {
        set root='hd0,gpt2'
        multiboot2 /home/anuradha/odyssey/odyssey
        module2 /home/anuradha/odyssey/modules/canary.bin canary
}
```

At the time of writing, only PS/2 keyboards are supported, and
since the Minnowboard doesn't support PS/2, disable "CONFIG_KEYBOARD"
when building odyssey on the Minnowboard and [use the USB to serial interface for
input](https://weeraman.com/connecting-to-the-minnowboard-using-a-console-cable-182d56e1479e)
via a second host.

## ARM

ARM support is also being tested on the BeagleBone Black Rev C single
board computer, though at the time of writing it is somewhat lagging
behind the Intel counterpart.

![BeagleBone Black Rev C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aweeraman/odyssey/master/docs/img/beagleboard_black_rev_c.jpg
"BeagleBone Black Rev C")

On BeagleBone black, use loady at the U-Boot prompt to load the image
over serial/ymodem via a secondary host using a USB to Serial FTDI cable:

```
$ make ARCH=arm
$ screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
[power-on the board]
[press space to interrupt auto-boot]
=> loady
<CTRL-a>:exec !! sx --ymodem odyssey.img
=> go 0x82000000
```

## Splash

The 'splash' command displays an image on the framebuffer. To specify an
image to converted to a C-header from a provided JPG, run the following
command:

```
$ tools/ppm-to-array/jpeg-to-c.sh tools/ppm-to-array/img/kanagawa.jpg include/ppm/splash.h
```

Build and launch Odyssey and run the 'splash' command at the shell.

# Debugging

~/.gdbinit:

```
set print pretty on
set architecture i386
target remote :1234
```

Enable following in config/build.cfg:

```
DEBUG     := yes
```

Run 'make boot' and in a different shell start gdb and set a breakpoint to
step through the code:

```
$ gdb odyssey
--snip--
x0000fff0 in ?? ()
Reading symbols from odyssey...
(gdb) break kernel_main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x100517: file arch/x86/boot/main.c, line 39.
(gdb) c
Continuing.
```
